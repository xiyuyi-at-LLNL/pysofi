Contributing
------------
`PySOFI` is an open source project. We welcome contributions via pull requests
on Github as well as questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues. 
Please also refer to our `code of conduct <https://github.com/xiyuyi-at-LLNL/pysofi/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.

If you are a developer, create a branch, include your changes and create a pull 
request to merge your branch to the master branch. If you are not a developer of 
the project, first create a fork of the repository. This will create your copy of 
the `PySOFI` repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub through
pull requests.

* Create your branches off the `repo:main` branch.
* Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
* Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., `Adds new privacy policy link to README`).
* Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
* Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
* Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
* Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting? What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?
